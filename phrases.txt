a vaguely sensuous light passed between them
she was strangely flattered by his interest
carried away by her own response, she failed to notice
her whole being seemed to be filled with waiting
when she saw him her only emotion was relief
the prolonged anticipation was almost unbearable
a sense of urgency drove her
she felt an eager affection coming from him
she could feel the sexual magnetism that made him so sell-confident
she saw the heart rending tenderness of his gaze
he looked her over seductively
he seemed to be peering at her intently
she stared with longing at him
every time his gaze met hers, her heart turned over in response
he looked at her as if he were photographing her with his eyes
he scanned her critically and beamed approval
his glance slid rapidly to her bathing suit and his mouth softened
his eyes raked boldly over her
his gaze dropped from her eyes to her shoulders to her breasts
his stare was bold and assessed her frankly
slowly and seductively, his gaze slid downward
he gave her body a raking gaze
his gaze roved and lazily appraised her
his gaze fell to the creamy expanse of her neck
she noticed he was watching her intently
he looked at her and the double meaning of his gaze was very obvious
his gaze was as soft as a caress
his steady gaze bore into her in silent expectation
his gaze traveled over her face and searched her eyes
his gaze was riveted on her face, then moved over her body slowly
something intense flared through his entrancement
she had to fight her overwhelming need to be close to him
there was a tingling in the pit of her stomach
her heart jolted and her pulse pounded
he was so disturbing to her in every way
she tried to throttle the dizzying current racing through her
she was by no means blind to his attraction
her curiosity, as well as her vanity, was aroused
he radiated a vitality that drew her like a magnet
he was as eager and erratic as a summer storm
there was an air of efficiency about him that fascinated her
something in his manner soothed her
there was a maddening hint of arrogance about him
her body ached for his touch
she dreamed of being crushed within his embrace
he had unlocked her heart and soul
she didn't miss his obvious examination and approval
every day, her love deepened and intensified
such an attraction would be perilous
he stoked a gently growing fire
the smoldering flame she saw in his eyes startled her
the idea sent her spirits soaring
she was pleased with their initial intimacy
she replied with complacent buoyancy
happiness filled her as she talked
she tried to learn him by heart
her feet seemed to be drifting along on a cloud
she found herself extremely conscious of his virile appeal
she was powerless to resist
each lime she saw him, the pull was stronger
she admired his driving intelligence
she felt a ripple of excitement
her interest stirred at their introduction
her attention perked up at the mention of him
there was a deeper significance to the visual interchange
his appeal was devastating
the very air around her seemed electrified
her heart danced with excitement
she felt a lurch of excitement within her
the implication sent waves of excitement through her
she felt an unwelcome surge of excitement
a slender delicate thread began to form between them
she drank in the comfort of his nearness
the sound of his voice affected her deeply
her heart ached under her breast
her insides jangled with excitement
it was a definite turn-on
the idea of his eagerness excited her
mentally, she caressed his qualities
a tiny glow cheered her
she tried to assess his unreadable features
she felt wrapped in an invisible warmth
her emotions melted her resolve
his invitation was a passionate challenge, hard to resist
she wasn't sure she liked the suggestive tone of his voice
despite his closed expression, she sensed his vulnerability
everything took on a clean brightness when he was around
her feelings for him were intensifying
he struck a vibrant chord in her
she was entranced by the silent sadness of his face
he brought her untried senses to life
she longed for the protectiveness of his arms
aching for the fulfillment of his lovemaking
his nearness made her senses spin
it was too easy to get lost in the way he looked at her
she was caught up in his enthusiasm
she felt a certain sadness that their day was ending
it wrapped around her like a warm blanket
she felt a curious swooping pull at her innards
she was totally entranced by his compelling personage
she felt like a breathless girl of eighteen
she couldn't deny the spark of excitement at the prospect
she was entirely caught up in her own emotions
her feelings for him had nothing to do with reason
she found herself studying his profile
she studied the lean dark-skinned face
she deliberately shut out any awareness of him
she pulled away, fighting back the tears
she refused his smug gesture of help
her breathing began to settle down to a more even beat
for a long moment she felt as if she were floating
she felt the movement of his breathing
her body felt heavy and warm
her pulse skittered alarmingly
the noise drowned out the thudding of her heart
a delicious shudder heated her body
the glimpses of his strong gold body made her heart beat more rapidly
she looked up and her heart lurched madly
she was shocked at the impact of his gentle grip
he was so very good-looking and she reacted so strongly to him
he was so compelling, his magnetism was so potent
his compelling eyes riveted her to the spot
her heart hammering in her cars
her heartbeat throbbed in her ears
he was so handsome in his black tux that her breath caught in her throat
she couldn't tear her gaze from his profile
her heart fluttered wildly in her breast
she could feel his heart thudding against her own
his vitality still captivated her
there was some tangible bond between them
she froze as her senses leapt to life
it was a purely sensual experience
she was quickly infected by his enthusiasm
she felt her pulses suddenly leap with excitement
he stood so close she could feel the heat from his body
she wanted him to find her desirable
it made her feel good, she was glad to be with him
aware of the strength and warmth of his flesh
in her haste to reassure him, she went too far
her reaction was swift and violent
her instinctive response to him was so powerful
she thought she detected a flicker in his intense eyes
he projected an energy and power that undeniably attracted her
his nearness was overwhelming
she cleared her throat, pretending not to be affected
her heart pounded an erratic rhythm
she couldn't help but notice the tingle of excitement inside her
she tingled as he said her name
she swallowed tightly as he dropped down next to her
she felt the electricity of his touch
at the base of her throat a pulse beat and swelled as
though her heart had risen from its usual place
she moved toward him, impelled involuntarily by her own passion
a delightful shiver of wanting ran through her
her pulse quickened at the speculation
her heart jumped erratically
his nearness kindled feelings of fire
her knees were weakened by the quivering of her limbs
her heart thudded noisily within her
his hands on her shoulders sent an involuntary chill through her
his touch upset her balance
the sweetly intoxicating musk of his body overwhelmed her
a rush of pink stained her cheeks
their closeness was like a drug, lulling her to euphoria
her heart thudded once, then settled back to its natural rhythm
his look was so galvanizing it sent a tremor through her
a shudder passed through her
she couldn't suppress an exclamation of admiration
her checks colored under the heat of his gaze
their eyes locked as their breathing came in unison
he was even more stunningly virile than she remembered
she bit her lip to stifle the outcry of delight
her heart took a perilous leap
she was filled with a strange inner excitement
she gave a genuine exclamation of delight
her heart seemed to rush to the spot he touched
her breast tingled against the silky fabric of her blouse
her heart thumped uncomfortably
a quiver surged through her veins
she heaved an affronted sigh
before she even turned around, she knew he was there
her heart hammered against her ribs
her wildly beating heart was the only sound audible
explosive currents raced through her
the teasing tone excited her despite silent protestations
her fingers ached to reach over and touch him
her heart began to hammer in her chest
she waited until her quickened pulse subsided
the pounding of her heart finally quieted
she couldn't miss the musky smell of him as he pressed her closer
his touch was oddly soft and caressing
she tried to deny the pulsing knot that bad formed in her stomach
the caress was a command
a knot rose in her throat
she waited until her quickened pulse had quieted
a passionate fluttering arose at the back of her neck
a hot ache grew in her throat
she implored him with her eyes
the answer was a rapid thud of her pulse
he made no attempt to hide the fact that be was watching her
his mouth throbbed with a passionate message
the nearness of him gave her comfort
she tried to ignore the strange aching in her limbs
she was only marginally aware of his assessment
she felt the blood surge from her fingertips to her toes
with a giddy sense of pleasure she let her happiness show
she felt her pulse beat in her throat
she gasped in delight
pulled by the vitality zinging through her
felt it racing through her bloodstream
her heartbeat skyrocketed
she felt blood coursing through her veins like an awakened river
she made a quick involuntary appraisal of his features
she inhaled sharply at the contact
her flesh prickled at his touch
she felt an immediate and total attraction
the harsh uneven rhythm of her breathing
a familiar shiver of awareness
a brief shiver rippled through her
she was enjoying his closeness as he checked his long
stride to match her own
her heart was hammering foolishly
the pit of her stomach churned
his broad shoulders were heaving as he breathed
his closeness was so male, so bracing
sending shivers of delight through her
she asked playfully, glancing at him
her heart was thundering
she felt drugged by his clean and manly scent
she considered him for a moment, then shrugged
pursing her lips, she thought about him
she hesitated a moment, watching him in profile
her communication skills seemed to have improved
her mind told her to resist, but her body refused
her skin prickled pleasurably
he appraised her with more than mild interest
he talked only to her, ignoring the others
the shock or him ran through her body
they shared an intense physical awareness of each other
an invisible web of attraction building between them
something pulled her attention to him
her heart beat with the pulse or the music
an undeniable magnetism was building between them
she did not want to tear her attention away from him
she wrenched herself away from her ridiculous
preoccupation with his arresting face
his large hand took her face and held it gently
he swung her into the circle of his arms
he pulled her roughly, almost violently, to him
twisting in his arms and arching her body, she sought to get free
he swept her, weightless, into his arms
gathering her into his arms, he held her snugly
gently he rocked her back and forth
without looking away, she backed out of his grasp
she buried her face against the corded muscles of his chest
his arms encircled her, one hand in the small of her back
his hands locked against her spine
his hands slipped up her arms, bringing her closer
he whispered into her hair
the touch of his hand was suddenly almost unbearable in its tenderness
she buried her face against his throat
as his grip tightened his attitude became more serious
she put her arms around his neck
in one forward motion, she was in his arms
suddenly she was lifted into the cradle of his arms
he stepped forward and clasped her body lightly to his
her soft curves molding to the contours of his lean body
she could feel his uneven breathing on her check, as be held her close
he wrapped his arms around her midriff
as though his words released her, she flung herself against him
his hands explored the hollows of her back
putting a large hand to her waist, he drew her form to him
he whispered, his breath hot against her ear
her eyelashes fluttered against his check
the warmth of his arms was so male, so bracing
she locked herself into his embrace
burying her hands in his thick hair
the magnificent man in her arms
at last, reluctantly, they parted a few inches
her head fit perfectly in the hollow between his shoulder and neck
she relaxed, sinking into his cushioning embrace
his embrace encompassed more than her waist
she dropped her chin on his chest with a sigh of pleasure
her trembling limbs clung to him
she had no desire to back out of his embrace
she settled back, enjoying the feel of his arms around her
his touch, firm and persuasive, invited more
she wound her arms inside his jacket and around his back
his breath was warm and moist against her face, and her heart raced
the mere touch of his hand sent a warming shiver through her
she was conscious of where his warm flesh touched her
her skin tingled when he touched her
the occasional jolt of his thigh brushing her hip
her body tingled from the contact
softly his breath fanned her face
she came up behind him, her arms locking around his waist
reclaiming her lips, be crushed her to him
her calm was shattered with the hunger of his kisses
his kiss was slow, thoughtful
his tongue sent shivers of desire racing through her
his tongue traced the soft fullness of her lips
his tongue explored the recesses of her mouth
he kissed her with his eyes
her lips were still warm and moist from his kiss
giving herself freely to the passion of his kiss
the kiss sent tho pit of her stomach into a wild swirl
the caress of his lips on her mouth and along her body set her aflame
his mouth covered hers hungrily
the strong hardness of his lips
his kiss sent new spirals of ecstasy through her
his lips were hard and searching
the cruel ravishment of his mouth
his kiss was surprisingly gentle
his kiss was punishing and angry
she felt the beady sensation of his lips against her neck
she kissed him with a hunger that belied her outward calm
his lips were more persuasive than she cared to admit
his lips brushed against hers as he spoke
raising his mouth from hers, be gazed into her eyes
he kissed the pulsing hollow at the base of her throat
his moist, firm mouth demanded a response
he brushed a gentle kiss across her forehead
his lips pressed against hers, then gently covered her mouth
leaving her mouth burning with fire
he moved his mouth over hers, devouring its softness
his last words were smothered on her lips
burying her face in his neck, she breathed a kiss there
his kiss sang through her veins
standing on tiptoe, she touched her lips to his
his slow, drugging kisses
even in remembrance, she felt the intimacy of his kisses
his kiss was urgent and exploratory
she was shocked at her own eager response to the touch of his lips
her mind relived the velvet warmth of his kiss
his lips continued to explore her soft ivory flesh
the touch of his lips was a delicious sensation
parting her lips, she raised herself to meet his kiss
his demanding lips caressed hers
his lips left hers to nibble at her earlobe
his lips seared a path down her neck, her shoulders
his lips recaptured hers, more demanding this time
she felt his lips touch her like a whisper
she returned his kiss with reckless abandon
she was forced to endure his punishing kiss
he kissed the tip of her nose
the touch of his lips on hers sent a shock wave through her entire body
his lips feather-touched her with tantalizing persuasion
she had a burning desire, an aching need, for another kiss
her lips burned in the aftermath of his fiery possession
he pressed her lips to his, caressing her mouth more than kissing it
the kiss was like the soldering heat that joins metals
he pressed a kiss in her palm before replying
his vow was scaled with a kiss
he smothered her lips with demanding mastery
he took her mouth with a savage intensity
it was divine ecstasy when he kissed her
his mouth did not become softer as he kissed her
she kissed his chin
crushing her to him, he pressed his mouth to hers
his lips slowly descended to meet hers
she quivered at the sweet tenderness of his kiss
he showered kisses around her lips and along her jaw
his mouth swooped down to capture hers
between each word, he planted kisses on her shoulders, neck, and face
his lips came coaxingly down on hers
she drank in the sweetness of his lips
a kiss as tender and light as a summer breeze
forcing her lips open with his thrusting tongue
he planted a tantalizing kiss in the hollow of her neck
she kissed him, lingering, savoring every moment
her lips found their way instinctively to his
his kiss was as challenging as it was rewarding
kissing her devouringly
she drew his face to hers in a renewed embrace
his lips parted hers in a soul-reaching massage
she succumbed to the forceful domination of his lips
his mouth grazed her earlobe
their lips met and she felt buffeted by the winds of a savage harmony
he kissed the top of her head
near-kisses wouldn't cause her to swoon
she pressed her open lips to his
his lips were warm and sweet on hers
there was a dreamy intimacy to their kiss now
she felt her knees weaken as his mouth descended
a series of slow, shivery kisses
she felt his lips brush her brow
the kiss left her weak and confused
first he kissed the tip of her nose, then her eyes, and,
finally, he satisfyingly kissed her soft mouth
it was a kiss for her tired soul to melt into
leaving her mouth burning with lire
she was shocked at her own eager response to the touch of his lips
the gentle massage sent currents of desire through her
shivers of delight followed his touch
as he roused her passion, his own grew stronger
her consciousness seemed to ebb and then flame more
distinct than ever
she felt transported on a soft and wispy cloud
her thoughts spun
her emotions whirled and skidded
pleasure radiated outward
her senses reeled as if short-circuited
she breathed lightly between parted lips
blood pounded in her brain, leapt from her heart, and made her knees tremble
gently he eased her down onto the bed
his lips touched her nipple with tantalizing possessiveness
he fondled one small globe, its pink nipple marble hard
his band unbuttoned her blouse, his fingers icy, but the palm fiery hot
his tongue caressed her sensitive swollen nipples
his hands slid across her silken belly
gently his hand outlined the circle of her breast
her breasts surged at the intimacy of his touch
he traced his fingertip across her lip
his tongue tantalized the buds which had swollen to their fullest
he eased the lacy cup of her bra aside
his hand moved under her dress to skim her hips and thighs
her dress crept up onto her thighs as she moved closer to him
his hand scared a path down her abdomen and onto her thigh
the gentle massage sent currents of desire through her
his touch was light and painfully teasing
his heartbeat throbbed against her car
exploring her thighs and then moving up
his lips teased a taut dusky pink nipple
his tongue made a path down her ribs to her stomach
his bands searched for pleasure points
one hand slid down her taut stomach to the swell of her hips
she curled into the curve of his body
the sleek caress of his body
his ardor was surprisingly, touchingly, restrained
he paused to kiss her, whispering his love for each part of her body
his hands moved gently down the length of her back
the stroking of his fingers sent pleasant jolts through her
his hands caressed the planes of her back
she matched his urgency with her own lusty, unsated needs
his hands moved magically over her smooth breasts
he took her hands, encouraging them to explore
she was gathered against a warm pulsing body
he began to slip his hands up her arms, ever so slowly
unbuttoning her blouse with trembling fingers
he gave her a quivering, tentative touch
she caressed the length of his back
instinctively, her body arched toward him
he was running his thumb deliciously up and down her palm
his hands explored the soft lines of her back, her waist, her hips
she caressed the strong tendons in the back of his neck
aroused now, she drew herself closer to him
his hands lightly traced a path over her skin
his hands slipped inside the neckline of her blouse
he rubbed the bare skin of her back and shoulders
hi.s hands explored the soft lines of her waist, her hips
his lips traced a sensuous path to ecstasy
she moaned softly as he lay her down
his tongue explored the rosy peaks of her breasts
her nipples firmed instantly under his touch
his body moved to partially cover hers
his hands began a lust-arousing exploration of her soft flesh
bodily he lifted her and laid her on the bed
his body imprisoned hers in a web of growing arousal
his hands roamed intimately over her breasts
the cool brush of his fingers on her skin
the rosy peaks grew to pebble hardness
he undressed her slowly, worshipfully
she gasped as he lowered his body over hers
it was flesh against flesh, man against woman
her breasts tingled against his hair-roughened chest
she writhed beneath him, eager to touch his skin
his lips brushed her nipples
her nipples, taut beneath the thin fabric
his tormented groan was a heady invitation
she lay panting, her chest heaving
they were able to take the time to explore, to arouse, to
give each other pleasure
her body squirmed beneath him
his hard body was atop hers
his hands lifted her robe above her hips
tucking her curves neatly into his own contours
the shapely beauty of her naked body taunted him
quickly she slid out from beneath him
his hand lightly touched her hardening nipples
their bodies naked and still moist from their lovemaking
she didn't protest when his hands sought the buttons of her blouse
he slid the gown off her shoulders, down her arms
discarding her clothes, she stood naked beneath his gaze
bringing their pink tips to crested peaks
she gasped as bare chest met hare chest
taking her hand, he guided it to himself
her full young breasts budded with pink
the light rippled on her ivory breasts
she lay in the haven of his love
outlining the tips of her breasts with his fingers
she felt her breasts crush against the hardness of his chest
skin to skin, they were as one
he kissed her taut nipples, rousing a melting sweetness within her
slowly his hands moved downward, skimming either side
of her body to her thighs
he explored her thighs then moved up to her taut stomach
she snuggled against him as their legs intertwined
his hand caressed the skin of her thigh
she trailed tickling fingers up and down his back
his fingers burned into her tingling skin
he picked up a lock of her hair and caressed it gently
passion pounded the blood through her heart, chest, and head
her body felt as if it was half icc and half flame
she breathed in deep soul-drenching drafts
her impatience grew to explosive proportions
his expert touch sent her to even higher levels of ecstasy
love flowed in her like warm honey
she shattered into a million glowing stars
she cried out for release
together they found the tempo that bound their bodies together
their bodies were in exquisite harmony with one another
soaring higher until the peak of delight was reached
exploding in a downpour of fiery sensations
contentment and peace flowed between them
she lay drowned in a flood-tide of the liberation of her mind and body
waves of ecstasy throbbed through her
succumbing to the numbed sleep of the satisfied lover
she welcomed him into her body
her body melted against his and the world was filled with him
the pleasure was pure and explosive
she desperately needed more of him than that first touch
the real world spun and careened on its axis
she gasped in sweet agony
she fantasized an even deeper ecstasy
while he would be merely filling a moment of physical desire, she would be allowing him to tear apart her soul
she felt her defenses weakening
the involuntary tremors of arousal began
the feeling was much more than sexual desire
shattering the bard shell that she had built so carefully
a golden wave of passion and love flowed between them
the feel of his rough skin against hers exalted her
the fire spread to her heart
her senses were spun by the scent of his freshly showered body

she was filled with an amazing sense of completeness
heat rippled under her skin as she recognized the flush of
sexual desire she hadn't felt for months
the dormant sexuality of her body had been awakened
she couldn't disguise her body's reaction
her heart bursting with love and anguish
her breath came in long, surrendering moans
she could feel the heat of his body course down the entire length of hers
shivers of delight followed his touch
as he roused her passion, his own grew stronger
she couldn't control the outcry of delight
she moaned aloud with an erotic pleasure
she k-new that the moment of ecstasy had passed
she yielded to the searing need which had been building for months
a moan of ecstasy slipped through her lips
his hardness electrified her
her whole being flooded with desire
passion inched through her veins
she was roused to the peak of desire
he sensed the awakening flames within her
sighed in pleasant exhaustion
she felt an awakened response deep within her
she was hurtled beyond the point of return
the names of passion burned within both of them
she was dismayed at the magnitude of her own desire
the passion of his ardor mounted
she never dreamed his hands would feel so warm, so gentle
hypnotized by his touch, she tingled under his fingertips
sweetly draining all her doubts and fears
she was drawn to a height of passion she had never known before
she surrendered completely to his masterful seduction
she exalted at the male strength, the cleanliness and beauty of him
passion radiated from the soft core of her body
she wanted to yield to the burning sweetness that seemed captive within her
her body began to vibrate with liquid fire

soared to an awesome, shuddering ecstasy

she knew the flooding of uncontrollable joy

gusts of desire shook her
her lips quivered in unspoken passion
she felt passion rising in her like the hottest lire, clouding her brain
an ache was sparked by that one indelible kiss
she was a glowing image of fire, passion, and love
she abandoned herself to the whirl of sensation
electricity seemed to arc through her
her thoughts fragmented as his hands and lips continued
their hungry search of her body
the turbulence of his passion swirled around her
the hot tide of passion raged through both of them
it was a raw act of possession
she savored the feeling of satisfaction he left with her
